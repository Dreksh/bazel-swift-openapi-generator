Updating the Version
--------------------

Simply run `bazel run //:update -- <version>`, where the version is the tag in the Swift OpenAPI Generator repository.
This will run a script that updates the files in this repo to point to a different version.

This script currently requires the following tools installed:
- `bazel`
- `curl`
- `git`
- `swift` (or Xcode for macOS)
